***This is the unofficial chrome os port***

SuperSploit is my first attempt at an exploit management system I took inspiration from Metasploit
but wanted a lighter filling platform this does not have any actual exploits in the exploit db
you will have get your self this is merely a exploit management platform.


**KEY POINTS**
    ***Based on metasploit***
    * Heavily tailored to chrome-os dev env
    * Lightweight
    * Able to run any platform with python3
    * Fully incorporated shell on linux
    * Auto-suggested inputs with history
    * Python allows for a more secure exploitation framework
    * Recon/Osnit mode that has nmap, phoneinfoga and more
