OSINT history: From spycraft to IT
    During the 1980s, the military and intelligence services began to shift some of their information-gathering
activities away from covert activities like trying to read an adversaryâ€™s mail or tapping their phones to
discover hidden secrets. Instead, effort was put into looking for useful intelligence that was freely
available or even officially published. The world at the time was changing, and even though social media had
not yet made the scene, there were plenty of sources like newspapers and publicly available databases that
contained interesting and sometimes useful information, especially if someone knew how to connect a lot of
dots. The term OSINT was originally coined to refer to this kind of spycraft. These same techniques can now be
applied to cybersecurity. Most organizations have vast, public-facing infrastructures that span many networks,
technologies, hosting services and namespaces. Information can be stored on employee desktops, in legacy on-prem
servers, with employee-owned devices, in the cloud, embedded inside devices like webcams, or even hidden in the
source code of active apps and programs. In fact, security and IT staff at large companies almost never knows
about every asset in their enterprise, public or not. Add in the fact that many organizations also own or
control several additional assets indirectly, such as their social media accounts, and there is potentially
a lot of information sitting out there that could be dangerous in the wrong hands.
