SuperSploit is my first attempt at an exploit management system I took inspiration from Metasploit.

Supersploit is a small python program, the program is capable of creating and handling backdoors 
along with initial exploit connections. 

**KEY POINTS**
    * Lightweight
    * Able to run any platform with python3
    * Fully incorporated shell on linux
    * Auto-suggested inputs with history
    * Python allows for a more secure exploitation framework
    * Recon/Osnit mode that has nmap, phoneinfoga and more
